### Project Description
 I built a responsive portfolio website from scratch.  I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and SASS.  I used NPM to install SASS, to compile the CSS file, and to run the SASS script. 
<br> I made a Home Page with a background image, my name, my slogan, and a few social media icons.  <br>For the menu, I made a menu button that once clicked rotates into an "X" and back again.  This is done entirely with CSS transitions and transform properties.  
The menu itself is an overlay with my photo on one side and the menu on the other. <br> The About Me Page is built with Grid CSS and Grid Template Areas. <br>The My Work Page is built with Grid CSS. <br>The Contact Me Page is built with Flex CSS and hover effects using CSS transitions. <br>This portfolio is totally responsive on all viewport sizes.
